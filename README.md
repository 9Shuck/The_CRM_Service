# The CRM Service 

### üìú Description: 

The objective is to create a REST API to manage customer data for a small shop. It will work as the backend side for a CRM interface that is being developed by a different team. <br>
<br>
The API should be only accessible by a registered user by providing an authentication mechanism.

Login with these credentials to access the API for the first time:
```
email: admin@crm.com
password: 123456aB
```
A User (no Admin) can: <br>
  ‚ñ∏ Create a new customer (with name, surname and photo). <br>
  ‚ñ∏ List all customers. <br>
  ‚ñ∏ Get full customer information. <br>
  ‚ñ∏ Update an existing customer. <br>
  ‚ñ∏ Delete an existing customer (soft delete). <br>
  <br>
 An Admin User can do the previous actions and manage users: <br>
  ‚ñ∏ Create users. <br>
  ‚ñ∏ List users. <br>
  ‚ñ∏ Update users. <br>
  ‚ñ∏ Delete users. <br>
  ‚ñ∏ Change admin status. <br>
  <br>
  Every time a customer is modified by a user, the relationship between them is stored in an association table called 'modifications'.
